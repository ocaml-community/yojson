Yojson: JSON library for OCaml
==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ocaml-community/yojson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ocaml-community/yojson)

This library parses JSON data into a nested OCaml tree data structure.


Library documentation
---------------------

Currently at [ocaml-community.github.io/yojson](https://ocaml-community.github.io/yojson/).


Examples
--------

A simple example on how to parse JSON from a string literal.

```ocaml
let json_string = {|
  {"number" : 42,
   "string" : "yes",
   "list": ["for", "sure", 42]}|}
(* val json_string : string *)

let json = Yojson.Safe.from_string json_string
(* val json : Yojson.Safe.t *)

Format.printf "Parsed to %a" Yojson.Safe.pp json
```


Related tooling
---------------

`Yojson` is a pretty common choice for parsing JSON in OCaml, as such it is the
base for a number of tools and libraries that are built on top of it.

* [`ppx_deriving_yojson`](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving_yojson) to
  automatically generate code that converts between `Yojson.Safe.t` and custom
  OCaml types
* [`ppx_yojson_conv`](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_yojson_conv), an
  alternative to `ppx_deriving_yojson` from Jane Street with different design
  decisions
* [`atd`](https://github.com/ahrefs/atd), generates mapping code from `.atd`
  specification files and can be used in multiple languages
* [`jsonm`](https://erratique.ch/software/jsonm) is an alternate JSON parser
  that parses JSON into a stream of items, so the complete data structure does
  not have to be in memory.
